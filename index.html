                    <p class="description">
                         <br>
                         Write a method named trackInvestment that computes the interest earned on a financial
                         investment. Once per year, the bank pays interest to the investor at a given
                         fixed rate. As the investment earns interest, that interest is added to the
                         investment and therefore the interest begins earning interest of its own ("compounding").
                         <br><br>
                         Your method should accept three parameters: the initial amount of the investment
                         in dollars (as a real number such as 1500.0 for $1,500.00), the yearly interest
                         rate (as a real number such as 3.5 for 3.5% interest) and the number of years for
                         which to invest (as an integer such as 6 for 6 years).
                         <br><br>
                         Your method should print the value of the investment after each year, as well as
                         the total amount of interest earned over all years. For example, an investment of
                         $100.00 at 10% interest for 5 years would lead to this call:
